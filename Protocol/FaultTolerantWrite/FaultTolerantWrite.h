Module Name:

  FaultTolerantWrite.h

Abstract:

  Fault Tolerant Write protocol as defined in the Tiano Fault Tolerant Write
  specification.

  This boot service only protocol provides fault tolerant write capability for 
  block devices.  The protocol provides for non-volatile intermediate storage 
  of the data and private information a caller would need to recover from a
  critical fault, such as power failure.

Routine Description:

  Query the largest block that may be updated in a fault tolerant manner.

Arguments:

  This       - Indicates a pointer to the calling context.  
  BlockSize  - A pointer to a caller allocated UINTN that is updated to 
               indicate the size of the largest block that can be updated.

Returns:

  EFI_SUCCESS   - The function completed successfully
  EFI_ABORTED   - The function could not complete successfully.

/*++

Routine Description:

  Allocates space for the protocol to maintain information about writes. 
  Since writes must be completed in a fault tolerant manner and multiple 
  updates will require more resources to be successful, this function 
  enables the protocol to ensure that enough space exists to track 
  information about the upcoming writes.

Arguments:

  This             - Indicates a pointer to the calling context.  
  CallerId         - The GUID identifying the write.
  PrivateDataSize  - The size of the caller's private data 
                     that must be recorded for each write.
  NumberOfWrites   - The number of fault tolerant block writes 
                     that will need to occur.

Returns:

  EFI_SUCCESS        - The function completed successfully
  EFI_ABORTED        - The function could not complete successfully.
  EFI_ACCESS_DENIED  - All allocated writes have not been completed.  
                       All writes must be completed or aborted before 
                       another fault tolerant write can occur.

/*++

Routine Description:

  Starts a target block update. This records information about the write 
  in fault tolerant storage and will complete the write in a recoverable 
  manner, ensuring at all times that either the original contents or 
  the modified contents are available.

Arguments:

  This             - Calling context
  Lba              - The logical block address of the target block.  
  Offset           - The offset within the target block to place the data.
  Length           - The number of bytes to write to the target block.
  PrivateData      - A pointer to private data that the caller requires to 
                     complete any pending writes in the event of a fault.
  FvBlockHandle    - The handle of FVB protocol that provides services for 
                     reading, writing, and erasing the target block.
  Buffer           - The data to write.

Returns:

  EFI_SUCCESS          - The function completed successfully
  EFI_ABORTED          - The function could not complete successfully.
  EFI_BAD_BUFFER_SIZE  - The write would span a block boundary, 
                         which is not a valid action.
  EFI_ACCESS_DENIED    - No writes have been allocated.
  EFI_NOT_READY        - The last write has not been completed.  
                         Restart () must be called to complete it.

Arguments:

  FvBlockProtocol     - The handle of FVB protocol that provides services for 
                        reading, writing, and erasing the target block.

Returns:
