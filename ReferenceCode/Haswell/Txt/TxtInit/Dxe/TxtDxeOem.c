  This file contain OEM/Platform implementation for TXT in DXE phase.  It represents an abstract outline of the
  steps required during DXE for enabling TXT.  Each individual step is further
  abstracted behind a function call interface.  This is intended to minimize
  the need to modify this file when porting TXT to future platforms.

  This function gets called before/after run the SCHECK function, intend to avoid platform specific SMIs to interfere in BIOS POST
  if BIOS SMM MP services or synchonization code is not well considered that some of APs are not waken up from Wait-for-SIPI state.
  Function should preserve original SMI enabling setting in augument is TRUE, and then restore it in augurment is FALSE.
  The caller is DisableSmiSources() in TxtDxeLib.c

  @param[in] TxtDxeCtx        - Point to TXT_DXE_LIB_CONTEXT structure
  @param[in] Operation        = TRUE    - Calling before SCHECK to saved and disable platform specific SMIs setting
                   = FALSE   - Calling after SCHECK to restore platform specific SMIs setting

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS   - Always.
