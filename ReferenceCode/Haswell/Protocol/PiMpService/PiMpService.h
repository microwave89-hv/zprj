  This service retrieves the number of logical processor in the platform
  and the number of those logical processors that are enabled on this boot.
  This service may only be called from the BSP.

  This function is used to retrieve the following information:
    - The number of logical processors that are present in the system.
    - The number of enabled logical processors in the system at the instant
      this call is made.

  Because MP Service Protocol provides services to enable and disable processors
  dynamically, the number of enabled logical processors may vary during the
  course of a boot session.

  If this service is called from an AP, then EFI_DEVICE_ERROR is returned.
  If NumberOfProcessors or NumberOfEnabledProcessors is NULL, then
  EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER is returned. Otherwise, the total number of processors
  is returned in NumberOfProcessors, the number of currently enabled processor
  is returned in NumberOfEnabledProcessors, and EFI_SUCCESS is returned.

/**
  This service executes a caller provided function on all enabled APs. APs can
  run either simultaneously or one at a time in sequence. This service supports
  both blocking and non-blocking requests. The non-blocking requests use EFI
  events so the BSP can detect when the APs have finished. This service may only
  be called from the BSP.

  This function is used to dispatch all the enabled APs to the function specified
  by Procedure.  If any enabled AP is busy, then EFI_NOT_READY is returned
  immediately and Procedure is not started on any AP.

  If SingleThread is TRUE, all the enabled APs execute the function specified by
  Procedure one by one, in ascending order of processor handle number. Otherwise,
  all the enabled APs execute the function specified by Procedure simultaneously.

  If WaitEvent is NULL, execution is in blocking mode. The BSP waits until all
  APs finish or TimeoutInMicroSecs expires. Otherwise, execution is in non-blocking
  mode, and the BSP returns from this service without waiting for APs. If a
  non-blocking mode is requested after the UEFI Event EFI_EVENT_GROUP_READY_TO_BOOT
  is signaled, then EFI_UNSUPPORTED must be returned.

  If the timeout specified by TimeoutInMicroseconds expires before all APs return
  from Procedure, then Procedure on the failed APs is terminated. All enabled APs
  are always available for further calls to EFI_PI_MP_SERVICES_PROTOCOL.StartupAllAPs()
  and EFI_PI_MP_SERVICES_PROTOCOL.StartupThisAP(). If FailedCpuList is not NULL, its
  content points to the list of processor handle numbers in which Procedure was
  terminated.

  Note: It is the responsibility of the consumer of the EFI_PI_MP_SERVICES_PROTOCOL.StartupAllAPs()
  to make sure that the nature of the code that is executed on the BSP and the
  dispatched APs is well controlled. The MP Services Protocol does not guarantee
  that the Procedure function is MP-safe. Hence, the tasks that can be run in
  parallel are limited to certain independent tasks and well-controlled exclusive
  code. EFI services and protocols may not be called by APs unless otherwise
  specified.

  In blocking execution mode, BSP waits until all APs finish or
  TimeoutInMicroSeconds expires.

  In non-blocking execution mode, BSP is freed to return to the caller and then
  proceed to the next task without having to wait for APs. The following
  sequence needs to occur in a non-blocking execution mode:

    -# The caller that intends to use this MP Services Protocol in non-blocking
       mode creates WaitEvent by calling the EFI CreateEvent() service.  The caller
       invokes EFI_PI_MP_SERVICES_PROTOCOL.StartupAllAPs(). If the parameter WaitEvent
       is not NULL, then StartupAllAPs() executes in non-blocking mode. It requests
       the function specified by Procedure to be started on all the enabled APs,
       and releases the BSP to continue with other tasks.
    -# The caller can use the CheckEvent() and WaitForEvent() services to check
       the state of the WaitEvent created in step 1.
    -# When the APs complete their task or TimeoutInMicroSecondss expires, the MP
       Service signals WaitEvent by calling the EFI SignalEvent() function. If
       FailedCpuList is not NULL, its content is available when WaitEvent is
       signaled. If all APs returned from Procedure prior to the timeout, then
       FailedCpuList is set to NULL. If not all APs return from Procedure before
       the timeout, then FailedCpuList is filled in with the list of the failed
       APs. The buffer is allocated by MP Service Protocol using AllocatePool().
       It is the caller's responsibility to free the buffer with FreePool() service.
    -# This invocation of SignalEvent() function informs the caller that invoked
       EFI_PI_MP_SERVICES_PROTOCOL.StartupAllAPs() that either all the APs completed
       the specified task or a timeout occurred. The contents of FailedCpuList
       can be examined to determine which APs did not complete the specified task
       prior to the timeout.

  @param[in] Procedure             - A pointer to the function to be run on enabled APs of the system.
