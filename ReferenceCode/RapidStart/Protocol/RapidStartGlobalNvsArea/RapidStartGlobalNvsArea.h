/** @file
  Definition of the RapidStart global NVS area protocol.  This protocol
  publishes the address and format of a global ACPI NVS buffer used as a communications
  buffer between SMM/DXE/PEI code and ASL code.
  @todo The format is derived from the ACPI reference code, version 0.95.

  Note:  Data structures defined in this protocol are not naturally aligned.
