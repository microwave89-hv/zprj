/**
  RapidStart DXE Platform Platform Policy Protocol

  This protocol provides an interface for platform code to configure Rapid Start
  behavior and usable resource without modifying reference code.

  This protocol provides interface to configure Rapid Start policy. Platform code
  should initialize this protocol before RapidStartDxe driver executing basing on
  the platform implementation. RapidStartDxePolicyInit sample code provided to
  initialize default settings which has been validated by CRB BIOS. Platform code
  can include this sample code with some porting to make it setup menu
  controllable.
