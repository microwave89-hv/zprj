  Retrieves a Unicode string that is the user readable name of
  the controller that is being managed by an EFI Driver.

  @param[in] This                 A pointer to the EFI_COMPONENT_NAME_PROTOCOL instance.
  @param[in] ControllerHandle     The handle of a controller that the driver specified by
                                  This is managing.  This handle specifies the controller
                                  whose name is to be returned.
  @param[in] ChildHandle          The handle of the child controller to retrieve the name
                                  of. This is an optional parameter that may be NULL.  It
                                  will be NULL for device drivers.  It will also be NULL
                                  for a bus drivers that wish to retrieve the name of the
                                  bus controller.  It will not be NULL for a bus driver
                                  that wishes to retrieve the name of a child controller.
  @param[in] Language             A pointer to a three character ISO 639-2 language
                                  identifier.  This is the language of the controller name
                                  that that the caller is requesting, and it must match one
                                  of the languages specified in SupportedLanguages.  The
                                  number of languages supported by a driver is up to the
                                  driver writer.
  @param[in] ControllerName       A pointer to the Unicode string to return. This Unicode
                                  string is the name of the controller specified by
                                  ControllerHandle and ChildHandle in the language
                                  specified by Language from the point of view of the
                                  driver specified by This.

                                  language specified by Language for the driver
                                  specified by This was returned in DriverName.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER   ControllerHandle is not a valid EFI_HANDLE. Language
                                  or ControllerName is NULL.
  @exception EFI_UNSUPPORTED      The driver specified by this is not currently
                                  managing the controller specified by
                                  ControllerHandle and ChildHandle. Or the driver
