@brief
  Reset the MC IO module. The MC hardware will handle creating the 20 dclk pulse
  after the bit is set and will also clear the bit.

  @param[in] MrcData - Include all MRC global data.

  @retval mrcSuccess    - IO Reset was done successfully
  @retval mrcDeviceBusy - Timed out waiting for the IO to clear the bit
