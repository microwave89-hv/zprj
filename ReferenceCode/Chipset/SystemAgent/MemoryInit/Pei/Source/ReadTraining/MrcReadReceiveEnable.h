/**
@brief
  Once the DQS high phase has been found (for each DRAM) the next stage is to find out the round trip latency,
  by locating the preamble cycle. This is achieved by trying smaller and smaller roundtrip
  values until the strobe sampling is done on the preamble cycle.
  The following algorithm is used to find the preamble cycle:

  @param[in] MrcData         - all the global data
