  Register an IO trap SMI child handler for a specified SMI.
  This service will register a child for a given SMI source.

  This includes base address, length, and type (read, write, read/write).
  The service will allocate the IO range if the base address is 0, and the RegisterContext
  Address field will be updated and returned to the caller.
  The service will allocate system resources via GCD services for the requested IO trap range and type.
  An error will be returned if insufficient resources are available to fulfill the request.
  The service will not perform GCD allocation if the base address is non-zero.  In this case,
  the caller is responsible for the existence and allocation of the specific IO range.
  An error may be returned if some or all of the requested resources conflict with an existing IO trap child handler.
  It is not required that implementations will allow multiple children for a single IO trap SMI source.
  Some implementations may support multiple children.
